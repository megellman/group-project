## User Story Example Example

AS A Host
I WANT to be able to easily navigate a recipe site
SO THAT I can find what I am looking for

![Nav bar ire frame](assets/images/navbar.png)

We want our users to be able to navigate multiple ways to get to whatever portion of our site they want to be on with as few clicks possible. In our wire frame we have a conceptual nav bar that will do just that. 

![HTML code snippet](assets/images/navsnippet.png)
we write out our nave bar in HTML and style it with Tailwind. For consistency copy this code snippet into each page of our site. This allows our our users to acesses miltiple sections of our website with just one click.  The logo even takes you back to the homepage.

![JS code snippet](assets/images/jscodesnip.png)
In our JS we have event handlers on all of the tabs. When you click on the two search tabs they hide the content of the current page that you are on and dynamically generate the search form. 
We had a moment of pivot in our design while in our learning process we discovered that when you change HTML pages the DOM loads fresh and you are not able to tell an event handler to switch the page and then perform other tasks. This is why we chose to dynamically generate our form and instead of bring the user to it we now bring it to the user.
